#  AI Research Data Processor 📊

An intelligent Python application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to process and standardize unstructured text data generated by AI into a structured Excel format. This project was developed as a tool to streamline academic research by automating the process of data entry.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **GUI for Easy Use:** A modern, user-friendly graphical interface built with PySide6 for intuitive data processing.
* **Flexible Data Parsing:** Reads data from a simple text file (`.txt`) with a user-defined delimiter (`%`).
* **Intelligent Delimiter Handling:**
    * **Maxsplit Logic:** Processes rows with inconsistent column counts by intelligently placing all remaining content into the last column.
    * **User Control:** Provides a checkbox to toggle this feature on or off.
* **Duplicate Header Management:** Automatically detects and skips repeated header rows in the data, preventing redundant entries.
* **Error & Warning Reporting:** Provides a comprehensive report of any issues (like missing files, inconsistent column counts, or extra delimiters) in a pop-up window after processing.
* **Multilingual Interface:** Supports multiple languages, including English, Persian, and others, through a simple dropdown menu.
* **Excel Output:** Converts the processed data into a clean, ready-to-use Excel file (`.xlsx`) using the pandas library.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.13.5:** The core programming language for the project.
* **PySide6:** A professional, cross-platform framework for creating the GUI.
* **pandas:** An essential library for data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
* **openpyxl:** A library used by pandas to read and write Excel files (`.xlsx`).
* **os & sys:** Standard Python modules for interacting with the operating system and file paths.

### ⚙️ Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    You can clone the repository using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ahmadreza-hajtalebi/ai-text-to-excel-tool.git
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can download the project files directly from the repository's main page.

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    The project uses a `requirements.txt` file to list all dependencies. Install them with a single command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Prepare your input file:**
    * Create a text file (e.g., `input_data.txt`) in the `data/` folder.
    * The first line must be the column headers, separated by a `%` delimiter.
    * Subsequent lines should contain your data, also separated by a `%`.
    * **Example format:**
        ```
        Poem_Title%Verse_ID%Material_Mentioned%Material_Property
        The Raven%7%Oak%Durability%Toughness
        The Charge of the Light Brigade%22%Steel%__
        ```

2.  **Get structured data from AI:**
    * To get data from an AI that is compatible with this script, use the prompt template provided in the `prompts/` folder.
    * The template helps you define the research subject, columns, and required output format.
    * **You can find the template file here:** [ai_prompt_template.txt](prompts/ai_prompt_template.txt)

3.  **Run the GUI:**
    * Navigate to the `gui/` directory.
    * Execute the main application script:
        ```bash
        python main_app.py
        ```

4.  **Process your data:**
    * Use the "Browse" buttons to select your input and output file paths.
    * Enter the exact number of columns (e.g., 4).
    * (Optional) Check the box to ignore extra delimiters.
    * Click the "Process Data" button.

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap

* **Add supplementary tools for advanced Excel management (e.g., automatic column sizing, data sorting, and filtering).**
* **Add More Languages:** Expand the translation dictionary to include more languages.
* **Interactive Error Display:** Display errors and warnings directly in a text widget on the GUI instead of a pop-up message box.
* **Merge Existing Excel Data:** Add an option to merge new data into an existing Excel file instead of creating a new one.
* **Dark/Light Theme:** Implement a dark mode or other visual themes.
