I need your help with my research. Please provide the information in a specific format based on the following instructions, so I can convert it into an Excel file using my Python script.

**[Describe your project and the general goal of your research]:**
For example:
"Analyze Persian poetry with a focus on identifying materials and their properties."

**[Text or subject you want to analyze]:**
For example:
"Based on the story of Rostam and Sohrab from the Shahnameh, identify all the tools and materials mentioned."

**[Instructions for structuring the output]:**
* The output must be in raw text format.
* Each row of data must be on a separate line.
* Columns must be separated by the '%' delimiter.
* The first line of the output must contain the table headers.

**[Define your headers and column content]:**
* The headers for the table are exactly as follows:
**[Your list of headers, separated by %]**

For example:
"ID%Concept%Example%Description%Source"

* The content of each column should be filled based on the following descriptions:
    * **[First Header]**: [Describe what the content of this column should be]
    * **[Second Header]**: [Describe what the content of this column should be]
    * ...
    * **[Last Header]**: [Describe what the content of this column should be]

**After your analysis, please provide the output exactly in this structure.**
